                        I joined IBSA because I wanted to take part in creating a safe, comfortable, and beneficial space for Indonesian students at UCLA. During my freshman year, I found that having friends who understand the cultural gap I had living in the US and experienced the same struggles as I did really helped get me through my first year at UCLA. Hence, I wanted to provide others with the same opportunity to help develop not only their support system at UCLA but also a strong network of relationships in the future.
